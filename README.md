# Taiko Sound Editor

**Note** I'm lacking the time irl to maintain consistent development of this tool. There may be updates from time to time only by some miracle. 
If you want to see features added, always feel free to fork this repository and change it as you wish.

A simple tool to automatize the process of converting music to .nus3bank format for Taiko Nijiiro game.

- big shoutout to [Nabix](https://github.com/Nabixlol) for reaching me with the idea to create this tool, testing it and
  offering careful and insightful guidance through all the conversion steps to someone who has never even heard about this game before :))
