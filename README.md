The versions older than 0.3 preview 2 use an outdated nus3bank template that result in the sound to hear louder in-game. 

As the conversion process is tedious, especially when many songs are implied, I made this tool to automatically fix the .nus3bank files to match
the newer template.

## How to use

**Backup your .nus3bank files before using this tool!!!**

In your file explorer, select the .nus3bank files you want and drag them to TaikoNus3BankTemplateFix.exe. 
The files will be overwritten with the new version of the nusbank.

In command line,

```
TaikoNus3BankTemplateFix.exe path\to\song_file1.nus3bank path\to\song_file2.nus3bank ...
```
